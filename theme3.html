    <h1>Theme 3 - Basic Animation</h1>
    <article>
       In this theme we got introduced to Javascript for the first time, we learned a lot about CSS animations and character creation. We worked further with Adobe Illustrator in order to make our first backgrounds and characters. It resulted in creating a sprite animation on the background and then a Javascript controlled animation. We had a chance to work in pairs during Project Pool and finally, develop a gamified onboarding solution for future KEA students. 
    </article>

    <div class="project slide-in2">
        <h3>Sprite animation</h3>
        <article>  In this assignment we had to create our own character and background and then put it all together in a sprite animation controlled with CSS. I made a platypus inspired by Nordic mythology that is getting shot with an arrow while standing in a dark, mystical forest.  </article>
         <img src="3BasicAnimation/sprite3.png" class="scroll" alt="screenshots from sprite animation with a platypus">
         <div class="button slide scroll" id="sprite">Open the sprite</div>
       
    </div>
     <div class="project2 scroll">
     <h3>Javascript animation</h3>
     <article>  This animation is based on 10 different CSS Animation, but its functionality is controlled by Javascript. Clicking on buttons makes different animationsstart and stop. Once again it involves a platypus character, this time in a more pleasant setting.  </article>
     <img src="3BasicAnimation/animation3.png" class="scroll" alt="screenshots from javascript controlled animation with a platypus">
     <div class="button slide scroll" id="anim">Open the project</div>
   

    </div>
    <div class="project3 scroll">
        <h3>Project pool</h3>
        <article>  During project pool we had a chance to work with different tasks - it was up to us which solution we want to work on. We could develop some of the advanced features or stick to the basic versions. It allowed us to improve our knowledge of Javascript and practice what we learned earlier. </article>
        <h2>Project pool day 1</h2>
             <article>I made an improved version of the colorful bubbles project we've done in pairs on first day of project pool. I have implemented some movement, as well as made new set of bubbles appear with each screen resize. </article>
     <img src="3BasicAnimation/prpool4.png" class="scroll" alt="preview of project with colorful bubbles">
     <div class="button slide scroll" id="prpool1">Open the project</div>
     <h2>Project pool day 2</h2>
          <article>  I created the a "guess the number" game. User gets to know if their guess was too high or too low, I have also implemented two of the advanced features - guesses are displayed in a list, there's also a counter for how many times the user has tried to guess the number. When guessed correctly, the alert says how many guesses it took </article>
      <img src="3BasicAnimation/prpool3.jpg" class="scroll" alt="preview of project called guess the number">
     <div class="button slide scroll" id="prpool2">Open the project</div>
    </div>
    <div class="project4 scroll">
        <h3>Onboarding app</h3>
        <article>  Onboarding app was the final step in Basic Animation theme. We got introduced to the idea of gamification and had to come up with an interesting solution that would be useful for people who consider studying at KEA and moving to Denmark. In a group we created a solution that involves a main character - a detective who is trying to solve the mystery of missing sticky notes and gains knowledge about different KEA facilities along the way. </article>
