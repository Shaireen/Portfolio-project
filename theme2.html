    <h1>Theme 2 - Basic UX</h1>
    <article>
        During second theme we started to learn about interaction between users and user interfaces. We got introduced to data collection and different ways of research. We worked with observation, interviews, surveys... We also learned about content production, information architecture and different useful tools connected to it, such as card sorting and concept mapping. Moreover, we talked about copy and microcopy, continued working with prototypes and participated in Design Sprint for the first time.

        <h3>Data Collection</h3>
        <article> Our first attempt at data collection consisted of different methods of doing research (desk research, observation, survey and interview), as well as analysing the data and presenting it. We also had to show the knowledge we gained throughout the process in an easy and interesting way that grabs the reader's attention.  </article>

     <h3>Prototype</h3>
     <article>  In this assignment we had to do research on conventions regarding design, content and functionality (in this specific case, of websites connected to job searching),  as well as digital communication targeted towards international audience. We worked with copy and microcopy, UI kits, style tile, wireflows and conducted a "Think Aloud Test". </article>

        <h3>Design sprint</h3>
        <article>  At the end of Basic UX we had to work with design sprint metod in order to create a native app concept improving student life, targeted towards KEA students. During just five days we worked with many new methods, came up with many ideas, created sketches, prototypes and finished off with doing a demo pitch.</article>
