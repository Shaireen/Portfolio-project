    <h1>Theme 3 - Basic Animation</h1>
    <p>
       In this theme we got introduced to Javascript for the first time, we learned a lot about CSS animations and character creation. We worked further with Adobe Illustrator in order to make our first backgrounds and characters. It resulted in creating a sprite animation on the background and then a Javascript controlled animation. We had a chance to work in pairs during Project Pool and finally, develop a gamified onboarding solution for future KEA students. 
    </p>
    
</div>
    <div class="project slide-in2">
        <h3>Sprite animation</h3>
        <p>  In this assignment we had to create our own character and background and then put it all together in a sprite animation controlled with CSS. I made a platypus inspired by Nordic mythology that is getting shot with an arrow while standing in a dark, mystical forest.  </p>
        <h2>Inspirations</h2>
        <p>My main inspiration was kawaii style (big shiny eyes, blush on the cheeks, unrealistic proportions, full of cuteness, mostly pastel colors) and opposites (day and night, good and bad, dark and bright - base of the color palette), as well as two gods from norse mythology - Loki (god of mischief) and Baldr (god of light, joy, purity, and the summer sun).</p>
        <p>
        Usually characters drawn in kawaii style have an outline, but there are some exceptions, therefore I decided not to include outline in mycharacter design, as it gives it a bit more of a three dimensional look. There are no textures - main focus is on simplicity and cute look thatcatches the eye. Since color palette is based on opposites, half of the colors are bright and inspired by daylight and joy, the other half is dark, reminding of the night and evil. Characters are based on basic shape - circle, their appearance and accessories are inspired by norse mythology.

    </div>
     <div class="project2 scroll">
     <h3>Javascript animation</h3>
     <p>  This animation is based on 10 different CSS Animation, but its functionality is controlled by Javascript. Here we work with adding event listeners, toggling classes and calling certain functions. Clicking on buttons makes different animationsstart and stop. Once again it involves a platypus character, this time in a more pleasant setting.  </p>

    </div>
    <div class="project3 scroll">
        <h3>Project pool</h3>
        <p>  During project pool we had a chance to work with different tasks - it was up to us which solution we want to work on. We could develop some of the advanced features or stick to the basic versions. It allowed us to improve our knowledge of Javascript and practice what we learned earlier. </p>
        <h2>Project pool day 1</h2>
             <p>I made an improved version of the colorful bubbles project we've done in pairs on first day of project pool. I have implemented some movement, as well as made new set of bubbles appear with each screen resize. </p>
     <img src="../3BasicAnimation/prpool4.png" class="scroll" alt="preview of project with colorful bubbles">
     <div class="button slide scroll" id="prpool1">Open the project</div>
     <h2 class="scroll">Project pool day 2</h2>
          <p class="scroll">  I created the a "guess the number" game. User gets to know if their guess was too high or too low, I have also implemented two of the advanced features - guesses are displayed in a list, there's also a counter for how many times the user has tried to guess the number. When guessed correctly, the alert says how many guesses it took </p>

     <div class="button slide scroll" id="prpool2">Open the project</div>
    </div>
    <div class="project4 scroll">
        <h3>Onboarding app</h3>
        <p>  Onboarding app was the final step in Basic Animation theme. We got introduced to the idea of gamification and had to come up with an interesting solution that would be useful for people who consider studying at KEA and moving to Denmark. In a group we created a solution that involves a main character - a detective who is trying to solve the mystery of missing sticky notes and gains knowledge about different KEA facilities along the way. Characters and backgrounds are made in flat design style, we're using bright, contrasted colors and simple sans-serif fonts. </p>
