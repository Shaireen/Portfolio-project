    <h1>Theme 2 - Basic UX</h1>
    <p>
        During second theme we started to learn about interaction between users and user interfaces. We got introduced to data collection and different ways of research. We worked with observation, interviews, surveys... We also learned about content production, information architecture and different useful tools connected to it, such as card sorting and concept mapping. Moreover, we talked about copy and microcopy, continued working with prototypes and participated in Design Sprint for the first time. 
    </p>

        <h3>Data Collection</h3>
        <p> Our first attempt at data collection consisted of different methods of doing research (desk research, observation, survey and interview), as well as analysing the data and presenting it. We also had to show the knowledge we gained throughout the process in an easy and interesting way that grabs the reader's attention.  </p>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>The process of creating documentation involved many steps, mostly doing research... about methods of doing research. It was my first time working with some of them and collecting all the data required adequate preparation for conducting the observation (fx. remembering to have something to take notes, avoiding getting distracted) and interview (preparing to ask right questions, making the interviewed person feel welcome). I learned how to ask more precise questions and present data in an inviting, not overwhelming way.</p>

     <h3>Prototype</h3>
     <p>  In this assignment we had to do research on conventions regarding design, content and functionality (in this specific case, of websites connected to job searching),  as well as digital communication targeted towards international audience. We worked with copy and microcopy, UI kits, style tile, wireflows and conducted a "Think Aloud Test". </p>
     <h2>Process</h2>
     <p>The process consisted mainly of finding different websites and comparing them to each other in order to find similarities. We included some screenshots in the documentation to highlight the conventions. When creating the prototype, we began with low fidelity and then developed it further into a more complete, hi-fidelity version.</p>

        <h3>Design sprint</h3>
        <p>  At the end of Basic UX we had to work with design sprint metod in order to create a native app concept improving student life, targeted towards KEA students. During just five days we worked with many new methods, came up with many ideas, created sketches, prototypes and finished off with doing a demo pitch.</p>
