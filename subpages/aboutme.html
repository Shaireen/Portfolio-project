    <h1>about me</h1>
    <article>
       I'm a 20-year-old Polish girl interested in design, music and animals. I am currently living in Denmark and studying Multimedia Design and Communication at Copenhagen School of Design and Technology. Even though Poland is my home country, my heart belongs to Denmark – that’s why I decided to move abroad and continue my education there.

        <h3>passion</h3>
        <article>   I’m really passionate about web design and I find the process of creating a website extremely satisfying, especially when I finally manage to find a solution to all the issues. In my free time I like to draw, take photos, listen to music, learn Danish, cook and drink lots of coffee to keep me going. I also used to practice horse riding and had my own horse for a few years, it's probably still my biggest passion but unfortunately I had to give it up for now. </article>

     <h3 class="scroll">all in one</h3>
     <article class="scroll"> Even though my interests are all different, I wouldn't be who I am without them. Listening to music inspires me and calms me down, drawing lets me make a full use of my creativity... Everything plays its part. I believe that this collage is a perfect representation of me and what interests me the most. It's made out of photos I took, it also includes one of my digital drawings (which I'm very proud of!).</article>
