    <h1>Theme 4 - Basic Content</h1>
    <p>
        Fourth theme was probably the one covering the most topics. We worked with sound and videos, learned about media law and had to create a campaign website for Foodsharing Copenhagen. It required us to make use of all skills we have acquired so far in order to deliver a good final product. 
    </p>

        <h3>Campaign website</h3>
        <p>  Our campaign website made for Foodsharing Copenhagen was inspired by their design guidelines, we used the same typography and slightly different, balanced color scheme. We wanted to keep it friendly and inviting, as well as organised and easy to navigate through. The website includes a video made for campaign purposes and lots of tips and informations connected to food waste. </p>

     <div class="project2 scroll">
     <h3>Storyboard</h3>
     <p>  We had to create a storyboard for our campaign movie. The inspiration comes from different movie genres, action, romance, comedy... It includes each scene in a seperate frames, short descriptions and other relevant details, such as shots and props we're planning on using.</p>

    <div class="project3 scroll">
        <h3>Customer pitch</h3>
        <p>   We learned how to create a convincing pitch and what aspects should be in our focus. This presentation was prepared for our customer pitch at the end of the project, it includes some keywords and details we wanted to highlight while doing the pitch.</p>
